To run the app locally, place the 'server.R', 'ui.R', and 'cedarcreek_shiny.R' in the same folder with your data files and run. 

This app uses as input data dumps from the Zooniverse that have been pre-processed using the 'prepping_data_shiny_cedarcreek.R' code. It also takes shapefiles of the Cedar Creek site (available upon request). 

App is a work in progress! For comments, suggestions, or those wishing to explore these data further, please contact me at palme516@umn.edu.
